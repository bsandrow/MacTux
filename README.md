MacTux
======

Description
-----------

A boot splash for Plymouth (the boot splash program used by Ubuntu, Fedora,
etc) that mimics the Mac boot screen with the Apple logo in the middle (except
in this case it's Tux, the Linux logo). I got the idea from rEFIt, which shows
the same thing when you choose Linux from the boot menu.
